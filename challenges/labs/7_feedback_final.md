####Describe the boot camp: was it useful, difficult, simple?

I have encountered some errors that I've never seen so overcoming those was a bit difficult at first but it made me practice and learn. I would have loved to go deeper into security which is
what I'm not comfortable with

####Which topic was least familiar to you? Which topic was most familiar?

Least : mysql replication and TLS
Most : everything else

####Which topic did you feel was most helpful? Which topic was not useful, if any?

The overview of all the components for security, again I would have loved to go deeper on that. I liked also the advices on how to depict the cloudera distribution to our client, what's possible, what's not. 

####How long before you are ready to to install a production cluster by yourself? What do you need to work on?

I consider myself ready but I could use an upgrade on security

###Conclusion :
This training course format is way better than the classical training where you are not enclined to look for the problem and yourself and you just copy paste commands. The experience feedbacks where useful.
Thank you very much.
